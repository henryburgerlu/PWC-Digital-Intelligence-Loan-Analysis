This project was a part of the PWC Digital Intelligence job simluation program ob Forage: https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/digital-intelligence-kmu8
Objective: 
The goal of this project is to independently value a loan portfolio as of **31 December 2020**, in support of the client’s year-end audit based on the provided prompt and the dataset.
The dataset includes **monthly loan origination amounts** and **observed repayments** for vintages between **June 2019 and December 2020**. 
The following assumptions are made to approach this project: 
Customers keep repaying at the same rate as before.

There’s no increase in defaults or economic shocks.

No write-offs or losses are anticipated.

A 5% annual discount rate is used, converted to a monthly rate for DCF purposes.

The discount rate remains constant across the entire forecast period and does not reflect changing market or credit risk conditions.
